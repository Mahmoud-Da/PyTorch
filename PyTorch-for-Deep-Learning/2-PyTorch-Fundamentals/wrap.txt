*** 8. Why Use Machine Learning or Deep Learning ***
- Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning:
Traditional programming relies on explicitly defined rules.
Machine learning finds patterns from data instead of manually writing rules.

- Why Use Machine Learning?
Some problems (e.g., self-driving cars) are too complex to define with fixed rules.
ML helps when writing all possible rules is impractical.

- Machine Learning is Versatile:
ML can be used for almost anything if data can be converted into numbers.
Algorithms identify patterns from input data and generate outputs.

- When NOT to Use Machine Learning:
Google's Rule #1: If a simple rule-based system solves the problem, use that instead.
ML isn’t always the best solution—keep it simple when possible.
