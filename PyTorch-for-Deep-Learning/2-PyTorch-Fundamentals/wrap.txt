*** 8. Why Use Machine Learning or Deep Learning ***
- Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning:
Traditional programming relies on explicitly defined rules.
Machine learning finds patterns from data instead of manually writing rules.

- Why Use Machine Learning?
Some problems (e.g., self-driving cars) are too complex to define with fixed rules.
ML helps when writing all possible rules is impractical.

- Machine Learning is Versatile:
ML can be used for almost anything if data can be converted into numbers.
Algorithms identify patterns from input data and generate outputs.

- When NOT to Use Machine Learning:
Google's Rule #1: If a simple rule-based system solves the problem, use that instead.
ML isn’t always the best solution—keep it simple when possible.

*** 9. The Number 1 Rule of Machine Learning and What Is Deep Learning Good For ***
- When to Use Machine Learning & Deep Learning
1. Problems with Long Lists of Rules:
Traditional rule-based systems fail when the rules become too complex (e.g., self-driving cars).
ML/DL can handle problems where writing explicit rules is impractical.

2.Continually Changing Environments:
Deep learning models can adapt to new data and changing conditions.
Example: Driving in an unfamiliar location requires adjusting to new rules and environments.

3.Large Datasets
Deep learning excels at analyzing massive amounts of data to extract insights.
Example: Food 101 dataset—manually coding rules for 101 different foods would be overwhelming.

- When Not to Use Deep Learning
1.When Expandability is Required
Deep learning models have millions or even billions of parameters (weights and biases).
Understanding the decision-making process is difficult.

2.When a Traditional Approach is Sufficient
Google's Rule #1: If a simple rule-based system solves the problem, use that instead.

3.When Errors Are Unacceptable
Deep learning models make probabilistic predictions, meaning they are not always 100% correct.
If a mistake is critical (e.g., medical diagnosis, financial transactions), rule-based systems might be safer.

4.When There’s Limited Data
Deep learning models typically require large datasets to perform well.
However, techniques exist to work with smaller datasets effectively.

Key Takeaway
Machine learning and deep learning are powerful tools, but they are not always the best solution.
Choosing the right approach depends on the problem, data availability, and the need for accuracy and expandability.
