*** 2. Course Welcome and What Is Deep Learning ***
- Defining Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML): Turning data (images, text, numbers, etc.) into numbers
and finding patterns within those numbers using algorithms.

Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning focused on more complex algorithms,
particularly neural networks.

- Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning:
Artificial Intelligence (AI): The broadest category, encompassing everything related to machines performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence.
Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI, focusing on algorithms that learn patterns from data.
Deep Learning: A more specific subset of ML, usually involving neural networks and more advanced algorithms.


- Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning
Traditional Programming: You explicitly write rules for how to process data. 
Example: Writing a program to replicate your grandmotherâ€™s famous roast chicken recipe.
Inputs: Vegetables, chicken, seasoning, etc.
Rules: Instructions on how to prepare and cook.
Output: A beautifully cooked roast chicken.

Machine Learning: Instead of writing explicit rules, you provide input-output data, and the algorithm figures out the rules on its own.
Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled data (inputs and corresponding outputs).
Example: Given a set of ingredients (inputs) and finished dishes (outputs), the algorithm learns the relationship between them.

Traditional Programming
Inputs --> Rules --> Output

Machine Learning algorithm
Inputs --> Output --> Rules (Figures out)

- Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns to map inputs (features) to outputs (labels) using labeled data.
Example: A machine learning algorithm for predicting the correct recipe steps based on ingredients.
